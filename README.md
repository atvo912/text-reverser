# text-reverser

This is a very simple Text Reverser page created in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To run the page, simply run index.html in your web browser (assuming all files are within the same directory).

The user simply needs to type their input into the first textarea box for their original text, and as they type, the reversed output will automatically populate in the second textarea.

The maximum character limit is 300 characters, and this is displayed below the input text area for you.

There is a "Clear Text" button provided.
